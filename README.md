- [Agenda](https://fluttercon.dev/agenda/)
- [Speakers](https://fluttercon.dev/speakers/)

## Talks List

Following FlutterCon, I've asked all the speakers to share a link to their slides and I've collected [all the answers](https://twitter.com/biz84/status/1677621155769753601) in the table below. üëá
